# 📦 Source Folder

## Status: Clean Slate ✨

This folder is currently empty. We're building the game step-by-step using **A-Frame components** in `index.html`.

## Why Empty?

We're using the **MindAR A-Frame** approach, which means:
- All game logic is in `index.html` as A-Frame components
- No separate JavaScript modules needed (yet)
- Simpler, cleaner, more maintainable

## Future Use

As the game grows, we may add:
- Custom A-Frame components
- Helper utilities
- Game logic modules

But for now, **everything is in index.html** and it works great!

## Build Plan

See [`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`](../docs/BUILD_PLAN.md) for the step-by-step build plan.

**Keep it simple. Build step by step.** 🚀
